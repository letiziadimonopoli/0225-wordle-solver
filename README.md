This is a program to find the optimal next word in the Wordle game (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

game.py: runs n games of Wordle coordinating the other two classes and keeps track of the scores.
wordle.py: implements the game of Wordle, from choosing the word to guess to checking the correctness of a guess.

My work is in guesser.py.
